## Evolutionary Algorithm

### Simulated Annealing

### Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is a machine learning tool based on ideas from Darwinâ€™s concept of natural selection. It is based on mutation, crossover and selection. Genetic algorithm is available in R as part of _caret_ and _GA_ libraries. Genetic algorithm can be used to optimise feature selection for regression modelling at the expense of longer running time.
