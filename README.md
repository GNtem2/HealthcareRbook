The files were uploaded to github using git bash

Some issues have occurred between when the files were written in 2020 with bookdown version 0.21 and change in knitr. The file is_abs_path() was removed from knitr 1.34 has been removed in the latest version of knitr. This was resolved by downloading knitr version 1.33 from Archives and installing the tar.gz files.
